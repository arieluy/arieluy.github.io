I participate in the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://puzzles.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} and various other puzzlehunts, as a solver and writer on [teammate](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Teammate){:target="_blank"}. 

For Teammate Hunt 2025, I was the Hunt Director and Lead Editor. I also sometimes contribute to art for puzzlehunts, such as the [Wyrmhole](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/wyrmhole){:target="_blank"}, an infinitely zooming fractal/tessellation/collage.

If you want to try one of my puzzles, but are new to puzzlehunts, I would recommend [Starship Battle](https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/starship-battle){:target="_blank"} if you like logic and [Wildlife Watch](https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/wildlife-watch){:target="_blank"} if you like words.

My personal favorites are [Diagramless-ception](https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/diagramless-ception){:target="_blank"}, [Mixed-Up Mixtape](https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/mixed-up-mixtape){:target="_blank"}, and [The Reactor](https://2025.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/the-reactor){:target="_blank"}.
