Hi, I'm Ariel! I'm currently a software engineer at [Annapurna Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/annapurna-labs/) working on the Neuron compiler for [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/). In May 2021, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with my B.S. in Discrete Math and Computer Science. See my [projects](/projects) and [research](/academics#research). I'm particularly interested in programming language theory, parallel computing, and compilers.

I also do [lighting design](/lighting), make [art](/art), and write [puzzlehunts](/puzzles) occasionally.
