Hi, I'm Ariel. I'm currently a software engineer at [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/), working on ransomware protection for flash storage arrays. In May 2021, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with my B.S. in Discrete Math and Computer Science. See my [projects](/projects), [research](/academics#research), and [teaching](/academics#teaching). I'm particularly interested in programming language theory, parallel computing, and game development.

I also make [art](/art) and do [lighting design](/lighting) sometimes. I'm active in [puzzlehunts](/puzzles) as a member of teammate.
