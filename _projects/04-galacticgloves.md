*January 2019*

*Created for Build18 hardware hackathon.*

In a team of 3, created a Space Invaders-like game with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, using motion and pressure sensors on the fingertips of a glove to aim and shoot at monsters. I was the main software developer, and wrote C++ code to take input from hardware, manage game states, and output to an LED display. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/arieluy/GalacticGloves){:target="_blank"}\]
