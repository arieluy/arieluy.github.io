*Originally created for TartanHacks hackathon.*

Created a webapp with React.js to help plan for packing large items into a truck, by inserting, rearranging, and labeling rectangular objects of various sizes. Implemented collision detection so boxes cannot be placed overlapping, outside the truck, or be stacked too high. Also added csv imports, file save/load, and inventory management. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/arieluy/truckpack){:target="_blank"}\]
