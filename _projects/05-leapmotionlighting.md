*May 2018*

*Final project for Fundamentals of CS class.*

I created an interactive way to control theatrical lights using hand gestures, implemented with Python and Leap Motion. In particular, moving spotlights can be set to follow the direction of your index finger! You can also control the intensity and color of lights using only your hand motions. Sequences can be recorded and played back. \[[GitHub](https://github.com/arieluy/15-112-Term-Project){:target="_blank"}\] \[[demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH9EHDYDPZ0){:target="_blank"}\]
